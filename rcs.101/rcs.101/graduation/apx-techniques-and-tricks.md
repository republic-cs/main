# Apx: Techniques & Tricks

> We've used this page to compile a few famous/infamous DSA techniques (specifically to CP/coding challenges)
>
>
>
> It's not being listing as the main course in RCS.101. Due to the following reasons
>
>
>
> 1. Techniques & Tricks could be a hit-or-miss thing, also they're often just an optimisation.
> 2. In RCS our primary focus is to compile a systematic learning roadmap. While the so called "Tricks/Techniques" often being the opposite. We've specially put those here to prevent learners from being distracted (eg. learned all the tricks, while forgot the fundamentals)

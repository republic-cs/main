# âŒ› Divide & Conquer

> In [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer\_science), divide and conquer is an [algorithm design paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm\_design\_paradigm). A divide-and-conquer [algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm) [recursively](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion\_\(computer\_science\)) breaks down a problem into two or more sub-problems of the same or related type, until these become simple enough to be solved directly. The solutions to the sub-problems are then combined to give a solution to the original problem

> The divide-and-conquer technique is the basis of efficient algorithms for many problems, such as [sorting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting\_algorithm) (e.g., [quicksort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort), [merge sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge\_sort)), [multiplying large numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication\_algorithm) (e.g., the [Karatsuba algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karatsuba\_algorithm)), finding the [closest pair of points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closest\_pair\_of\_points\_problem), [syntactic analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic\_analysis) (e.g., [top-down parsers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-down\_parser)), and computing the [discrete Fourier transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete\_Fourier\_transform) ([FFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast\_Fourier\_transform)).[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide-and-conquer\_algorithm#cite\_note-1)

> Designing efficient divide-and-conquer algorithms can be difficult. As in [mathematical induction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical\_induction), it is often necessary to generalize the problem to make it amenable to a recursive solution. The correctness of a divide-and-conquer algorithm is usually proved by mathematical induction, and its computational cost is often determined by solving [recurrence relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrence\_relation).

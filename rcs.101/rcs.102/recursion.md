# ⌛ Recursion

{% hint style="info" %}
Recursive algorithms involve a function calling itself in order to solve a smaller version of a problem. In surface, recursion could look trivial and simple.

While the entire skill set of identifying sub-problems, settling the base case, crafting the merging process is uniquely challenging.



#### Learning Material (acquire basic understanding of recursion)

* [**5 Simple Steps for Solving Any Recursive Problem**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngCos392W4w)



#### **Learning Material (understand the essence of recursion: divide and conquer)**&#x20;

* [**1.8.4 Strong Induction: Video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUueMeRooBk) (give a taste on how mathematical induction works)
